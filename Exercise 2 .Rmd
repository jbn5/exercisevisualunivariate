This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
link='https://github.com/EvansDataScience/VisualAnalytics_2_tabularData/raw/master/data/eduwa.rda'
#getting the data TABLE from the file in the cloud:
load(file=url(link))
```

```{r}
tableFreqO=tableFreq[order(-tableFreq$pct),]
tableFreqO
```
```{r}
base = ggplot(data = tableFreq0,
              aes(x = offense, y = pct))

plot1 = base + geom_bar(fill ="gray",
                        stat = 'identity') + scale_x_discrete(limits=tableFreqO$offense) 
# y is just what it is!
plot1 
```




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
